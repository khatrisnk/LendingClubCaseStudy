## Recommendations

1. More than 4.5K defaulters are from MORTGAGE and RENT category of home ownership. It will be great to check the DTI and purpose for these categories before approval.
2. More than 16K loans are not verified. It will be benifial to the comapny if they can reduce the number by strenthening the verification process.
3. People are taking loan mostly for debt consolidation (one of the category in pupose), Approximate 3K loans are defaulters in this category. The total number is more than ~17K out of ~37K. This is a huge number. Company should think of their business approch. The number of loan for other purpose e.g. house, renewable energy and education is very low.
4. More than ~1K borrowers become defaulters out of ~7K borrowers for 10+ years category of employment length. The ratio is 1 out of 7. It will be great to check the DTI and purpose for those application before approval.
5. Approximately 13K loans belongs to category of less than year or more than 10 years. Please do proper verification before approval.
6. There are more defaulters belongs to state CA, TX, FL, NY anf NJ as there are more loans from these state. Please do strenthen the process of verification in these states.
7. DTI ratio should not be more than 13.5 to avoid defaulters.
8. Average annual income should be greater than 58K (USD) to avoid defaulters.
